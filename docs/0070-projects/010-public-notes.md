# Public Notes

## Technical Challenges

- Keeping people updated on changes and new entries is not as easy as when there's a timeline.
- It's not possible to have comments and discussions here.
- Documents don't have unique IDs. If they did, moving them would be much easier and the links to them would be more robust.
- Relocating documents breaks their links.
- Markdown links can derive their titles from the linked document, similar to the functionality provided by Confluence.
- If we can track a document, then we can create an update history for it.
