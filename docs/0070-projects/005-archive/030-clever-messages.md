# Clever Messages

## Why

As a non-native English speaker, I sometimes struggle to find the right words to write a message. I wanted to explore this problem space and see if I clarify the problem and come up with a solution.

## How

- Before ChatGPT was released, I was using GPT-3 in the OpenAI Playground to generate messages.
- Message generation can be done from a web app that gathers context from the user and generates the message using an LLM.

## What

- A landing page was created for generating messages using GPT-3 and to collect feedback from users.

## Challenges

- UI design is not my strong suit and I struggled to create a good landing page, and I ended up letting go of the idea of creating a "good" landing page and just focused on creating a landing page that works.
- I couldn't find the right channels to promote the landing page and get feedback from users. Therefore I got very little feedback from promoting the landing page on these generic channels:
  - I posted two posts on Reddit, one on [r/SideProject](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/zxjp4c/clever_messages_generate_messages_from_few_words/) and another one on [r/IMadeThis](https://www.reddit.com/r/IMadeThis/comments/zyj6gx/i_created_a_service_to_generate_messages/)
  - I posted on other channels I found in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/mmccaff/PlacesToPostYourStartup) which was referenced in [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/iv4ms7/list_of_places_where_to_post_your_product_to_get/).
- After a few days, I concluded that I can't find the target audience for this problem in the channels and I have to find better channels.
