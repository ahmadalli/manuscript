# Banking

## Observations

Compared to Iran, and what I've seen on other countries, there are some differences in the banking system in the Netherlands. The main difference is **credit cards are not common in here** and people mostly use debit cards.

The second difference is that Dutch banks used to use Maestro instead of Visa and Mastercard and because of that, [iDeal](#ideal) is the common payment gateway in the Netherlands. MasterCard is replacing Maestro in the Netherlands from July 2023 though.

## iDeal

In the absence of Visa and Mastercard, iDeal is the payment gateway in the Netherlands. It doesn't abstract away the bank from the payment process, so the payment site you're using must also support your bank as well. And so you need to select your bank from the list of banks when you're paying with iDeal.

It wouldn't be a problem with common Dutch banks but for banks like [Revolut][Revolut], I've seen places that did not support it when I didn't have a Dutch bank as my primary bank.

## International Payments

If you don't have Visa or Mastercard, you can use [Revolut][Revolut] virtual cards. As a plus, you can also get single use virtual cards that are useful when you don't trust the website you're paying on.

## Direct Debit

Direct debit is a common way of paying for subscriptions in the Netherlands. There are different ways that companies use to set up direct debit:

- **iDeal**
- **SEPA Direct Debit**: You can set up SEPA Direct Debit by providing your IBAN to the company.
