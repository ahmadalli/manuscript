## Biking

### Dutch Bikes

This vide from Not Just Bikes explains the differences between Dutch bikes and other bikes:

### Swapfiets

If you don't want to buy a Dutch bike, you can rent one from [Swapfiets][swapfiets]. It's a subscription service. Compared to buying a bike, Swapfiets has the following advantages:

- Since they are very common in the city, the chance of your bike getting stolen is lower.
- They are lighter compared to bikes in the same price range.
- You can get a new bike if your bike is broken.

But also, you have to get lucky to get a bike that runs smoothly. Most of the bikes have some problems.

### Google Maps Pitfalls

Unfortunately, Google Maps doesn't always have a good understanding of the bike paths in the Netherlands and it's the only viable option for navigation with a bike. So, it's a good idea to make sure you're on the right path by looking at the signs on the road and check if you're riding on bike paths and be prepared to take a different route if Google Maps tells you to go somewhere that doesn't look like a bike path.

## Public Transportation

### OV-Chipkaart

You can use OV-Chipkaart to pay for all kinds of public transportation in the Netherlands. There are two types of OV-Chipkaart.

#### Anonymous OV-Chipkaart

You can buy anonymous OV-Chipkaart from shops and chain supermarkets like Albert Heijn. These cards need to be topped up and you need to have at least 20 euros in your card to be able to use it on NS or 5 euros GVB (Amsterdam's public transport). You can check out [here][service-points-finder] to find a place to buy and top up anonymous OV-Chipkaart.

There's also [this weird way][ov-chipkaart-order-credit] of topping up your card online. I'm not completely sure how it works though.

Also, you can check your balance and travel history from the [ov-chipkaart website][ov-chipkaart] at all times.

#### Personal OV-Chipkaart

If you have access to a Dutch bank account (so that you can pay by iDEAL) or PayPal, you can order a personal OV-Chipkaart. Compared to the anonymous OV-Chipkaart, this card has the following advantages:

- You can set up automatic top-up or connect it to your bank account so that you don't have to worry about topping up your card.
- You can get a discount from different public transport companies like NS or GVB.
- You can get a refund by contacting support if you forget to check out

You can order a personal OV-Chipkaart from [the ov-chipkaart website][ov-chipkaart]. Or you can get one [by ordering a subscription from NS][ns-flex].

:::tip

The personal OV-Chipkaart costs 7.50 euros, but you can get it for free if you order a subscription from NS. I'll talk about NS subscriptions in the [NS](#ns) section.

:::

### NS

NS is the national railway company of the Netherlands. You can use NS to travel between cities. In addition to [service points][service-points-finder], you can also buy tickets from the NS website or NS app.

#### NS Flex

If you travel with NS at least once a month, check out [NS Flex][ns-flex] plans. The 40% off-peak discount is worth it based on my experience. You can also get a free personal OV-Chipkaart if you order a subscription from NS.

#### Off-peak Group Tickets

Off-peak group tickets are also a good option if you're traveling with a group of people. You can buy them from the [NS website][ns-offpeak-ticket] or NS app.

#### OV-Fiets

OV-Fiets is a daily bike rental service from NS. It can be useful if you'd like to check out a place by bike.

#### Bike in the Train

You can [buy a day ticket][ns-bike-in-train-ticket] and take your bike with you in the train on off-peak hours. Trains usually have a special compartment for bikes at both ends.

### Other Public Transport Companies

There are other public transport companies like GVB in Amsterdam or RET. These companies have their own rates and some offer subscriptions. You can check out their websites for more information.

:::caution

When you're switching between different public transport companies, you need to check out from one company and check in to the other company. Otherwise, you'll be charged for the maximum rate by both companies.

## Car Sharing

If you don't want to use public transportation, and [if you don't own a car](https://youtu.be/OObwqreAJ48) you can use car sharing services. I couldn't find a shared list of services used by NotJustBikes and I'd like to share the list of services I use or I'm aware of:
