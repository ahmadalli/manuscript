# Legally Settling In

As an expat, you need to do some paperwork to legally settle in the Netherlands. This includes getting a `BSN`, opening a bank account, getting health insurance, and registering at the municipality.

## Your Legal Identity

Your legal identity in the Netherlands comes from a combination of identities that you have. These include:
- Your birthday
- Your passport number
- Your v-number, which is a assigned to you by the IND (the immigration office)
- Your `BSN`, which is assigned to you by the municipality

:::caution

To protect your identity, it's important to keep at least your birthday and `BSN` private.

:::

### `BSN`

Other than `BSN`, you obtain the rest of your identities before you arrive in the Netherlands. You can find your `v-number` on your IND letter. We'll go through the process of getting a `BSN` in later sections.

`BSN` is the most important one. It's used for everything from opening a bank account, health insurance and taxation. You can get a `BSN` by registering at the municipality. You can find more information about this in the [Registration](#Registration) section.


## Before You Arrive

:::note

These are based on my experience coming from Iran. If you're coming from a different country, you might need to take different steps.

:::

You need to bring some **legalized** documents with you to the Netherlands. These include:
- Birth certificate
- Marriage certificate (if applicable)
- Driver's license (if applicable)
- University degree (if applicable)

These documents will be used when you're [registering](#registration) at the municipality.

Also if your employer is going to apply for a 30% ruling for you, they'll give you a list of documents that you need to bring with you. Also some documents can help you if the process 30% doesn't go smoothly. These include:

- University degree (if applicable)
- Previous employment contracts
- Previous payslips
- Bank statements of the last two years
- Proof of your previous address

## After You Arrive

### Phone Number

You need a phone number to be able to do a lot of things like opening a bank account. You can start with a prepaid sim card from [Lebara](https://mobile.lebara.com/nl/en) or [Lyca](https://www.lycamobile.nl/en/). You can switch to a better plan later after you've got your [bank account](#bank-account).

### Bank Account

After you arrived, you need to be able to pay for stuff (including short stay or deposit and rent) And you need to have a bank account for that. This is mostly problematic for residence of countries that don't have access to the internationally recognized payment systems like Visa and MasterCard.

On the other hand most banks require your `BSN` upon opening a bank account, which you get the first time you register at the municipality. This chicken and egg problem doesn't always have a straight forward solution specially if you don't have a temporary address. But if you have temporary address, some banks like [ABN AMRO](https://www.abnamro.nl/en/personal/specially-for/expats/international-clients-desk.html) and [Revolut](https://revolut.com) allow you to open a bank account without a `BSN` and give you eight weeks to provide it.

### Registration

If you're living more than 4 months in the Netherlands, you need to register at the municipality of your residential address. Your residential address must have free capacity for registration. Each municipality has a different rule for the maximum number of people that can live (and therefore register) in each address. You can find the municipality of your residential address [here](https://maps.amsterdam.nl/gebiedsindeling/?LANG=en) by selecting `Transport region municipalities`.

As an expat, you might not have a residential address when you arrive. There are two ways to tackle this problem:
- Your employer might be able to provide you with a temporary address, usually the office address. You need to ask HR about this and get proper documents from them.
- The place you're staying at might also be able to provide you with a temporary address. We stayed on [the student hotel](https://www.thestudenthotel.com/) which was able to provide us with a temporary address.
- You need to rent a place first before you can register. You can find more information about this in the [Renting An Apartment](renting-an-apartment.md).

### Residence Permit

If you're not an EU citizen, you need to have a visa sponsor (usually your employer or university) to apply for a visa for you and your family members. After your arrival, you need to collect your residence permit from IND desk of the place your visa sponsor is located. Your visa sponsor should provide you with the address of the IND desk. You can schedule an appointment with the IND desk [here](https://ind.nl/en/service-contact/make-an-appointment-with-the-ind).

### Health Insurance

You have to get health insurance in the Netherlands within 4 months of your arrival. You can compare different health insurance providers and get health insurance on [independer](https://www.independer.nl).
