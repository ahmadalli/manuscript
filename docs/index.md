# Intro

Hello :) This ia The Manuscript. A place where I write about things I like to share, my thoughts, my opinions, and generally things that I care about.

## Why

### Why not a blog?

It's not the first time that I'm writing. I always like the idea of sharing things and I find it valuable to share them publicly, because [there are limited number of keystrokes that you get in life](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes). I tried blogging multiple times, but recently It's been hard for me to express myself in linear format and I find blogging limiting in some areas:

- The linear format is limiting where there are lots of different areas that I'd like to write about. Having a two-dimensional structure seems more appropriate for this.
- A timeline format doesn't reflect the importance of stuff. There are things that reflect my core belief and would be written earlier but get less visibility because newer posts get their place on top of the timeline.

So I've decided to try something new. As part of my job, I write a lot of documentation, and this looks like a viable path to try: to document my own life.

### Why in English?

I've found myself in a situation where I find it challenging to express myself in English and this looks like a good opportunity to exercise expressing myself in English.

## What

I'd like to achieve the following things in this project:

- First and foremost, to express myself, write about things that I care about, and my thoughts and opinions.
- To share things I like to share with others. I see this a more valuable investment to iterate and improve documentations and I believe interesting things will be built on top of each other.
- A personal note space. I'd keep some personal notes like links to places I find useful, or even some shell commands that I use a lot. I'd like to keep them here so I can access them from anywhere and also to not look for them in multiple places.

## How

### Structure

I'm not completely sure about this part yet and I'm going to iterate through it until it feels right. For now, I'm afraid if I let my obsessions to take over, I might never actually start writing, so for now I'm going with something that just works. I have some categorization in my mind at the moment but things might move around a lot until I find the right structure.

## Challenges

### Consistency

Writing has always this challenge that its contents are not even a snapshot of my thoughts. Thoughts and beliefs constantly change and some of the changes would get a chance to be also reflected in here and some don't. It's not a problem to solve, but it's something to keep in mind.

### Some technical challenges

- Having a timelines means there are mechanics to keep people updated. There's no defined way of doing so in tis format. I have some ideas about this, but it's a problem to solve in another time.
- It's not possible to have comments and discussions in here.
