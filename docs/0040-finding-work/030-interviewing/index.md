# Interviewing

Every company has its own interview process. But there are some common steps that you can expect to go through in most companies.

## Recruiter Interview

Usually this is the first interview you get. This stage typically involves a short call with a recruiter from the company.

### Their Questions

They give you a brief introduction to the company and the position and usually cover the following topics:

#### Your Background and Experience

While recruiters are familiar with the general topics and technologies of the domain they're hiring for, they are not technical experts. Answers to their technical questions should be **concise**, **to the point**, and should **include common terms** of the domain.

This can go deeper than a summary of your resume, and you might be asked the following questions:

- Your technology stacks
- The technologies you're interested in
- **Numbers** and **metrics** related to your previous projects. Depending on the domain you're applying for these numbers can be the number of users, the number of requests, the number of servers, etc.

#### The Reason You're Looking for a New Job

It's acceptable to be open to new opportunities even if you're not actively seeking to leave your current job. You could respond like this:

> I'm not actively looking for a new job. But I'm open to new opportunities.

:::caution

Beware of behavioral red flags and avoid giving unprofessional answers to these questions. We'll cover this in more detail in the [Behavioral Interview](#behavioral-interview) section.

:::

They might also delve more deeply into behavioral questions. So, make sure to prepare for those questions as well.

#### Your Salary Expectations

Whether you have your salary expectations ready or not, **don't** give a number in this process. This gives you more freedom when you're negotiating your salary. You can say something like this:

> I'm not sure about the salary range for this position. I'd like to learn more about the position and the company before discussing salary.

The recruiters might persist in asking for a minimum salary range. Depending on your situation and knowledge of the market and company, you can provide the salary range that you believe to be reasonable and fair.

### Your Questions {#recruiter-interview-your-questions}

This is your first opportunity to learn about the company and the position. So, make sure to prepare a list of questions to ask the recruiter. I usually ask about the following topics:

- The reason they're hiring for this position
- Salary range for the position
- Contract length (if applicable)
- Size of the team
- Current technology stack
- **Some questions about their business**

:::tip

By asking questions about their business, you show that you're interested in the company and the position.

:::

### Interview Process

Recruiters usually explain the interview process in this interview. However, if they don't, you can ask them about the next steps in the process. It's good to note that sometimes recruitment processes change in the middle of the process and the changes might not be communicated to you. Be prepared for this and don't be surprised if the process doesn't go as you expected.

## Technical Interview

Depending on the domain, you may encounter a generic technical interview, or there might be different types of technical interviews like a **system design interview** or a **coding interview**. These interviews aim to evaluate your **knowledge**, but more importantly, they evaluate your **problem solving skills**.

:::info

In some interviews, you might be asked trivia questions that can be easily answered by a quick Google search. This is a sign of a bad interview process, and you might encounter more red flags in the company.

:::

:::tip

Technical interviews aim to assess your technical abilities. To preserve time, it's good to keep the introduction and small talk to a minimum.

:::

### Problem Solving in Technical Interviews

Problem-solving skills cannot be entirely learned from a few points, but some points get forgotten in the heat of the moment:

- Communicate with the interviewer
  - Ask questions: The given problem is usually intentionally vague, and you need to ask questions to get more information and clarify the problem
  - Think out loud: Explain your thought process to the interviewer and communicate your decisions
  - Look for hints: The interviewer might give you hints if you get stuck. But they won't give you hints if you don't ask for them
- Start with the first solution that comes to your mind and iterate on it
  - Don't try to find the optimal solution from the beginning
  - Don't over-complicate the problem. Start with a simpler version of the problem and then add more complexity to it if needed
- Discuss trade-offs if there are multiple solutions

### Coding Interview

This interview evaluates your ability to write code and your familiarity with **algorithms** and **data structures**. You might be asked to write code on a whiteboard, or you might be asked to solve a problem on a shared document or a code editor.

:::tip

Make sure that you're familiar with the common collaborative coding platforms like HackerRank and CoderPad. You can ask the recruiter about the platform they use for the coding interview.

#### Preparing for Coding Interview

There are some resources that can help you prepare for this interview:

- Algorithmic problem-solving sites like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/)
- Books like [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/55014663)

- Data Structure and Algorithms courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) or [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)

#### Their Questions

You might also be asked some questions about your code:

- Time and space complexity of your solution
- Further optimizations of your solution
- Theory behind the algorithms and data structures you used
- Trade-offs of your solution

### System Design Interview

This interview assesses your ability to design systems and evaluate trade-offs. You're asked to design a system that solves a given problem. The problem is usually intentionally vague, and you need to ask questions to get more information and clarify the problem. The interview is usually done on a whiteboard or a drawing platform and you're expected to draw diagrams of your design.

:::tip

Make sure that you're familiar with the common drawing platforms like Miro, Draw.io, HackerRank, Excalidraw, etc. You can ask the recruiter about the platform they use for the system design interview.
