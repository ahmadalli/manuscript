# Taking Videos

## General

- Capture in Log format if possible
- Record in 60fps or 30fps according to the desired look
  - 60fps is good for slow motion
- Make sure your shutter speed is twice the frame rate
  - Use ND filters to reduce the shutter speed
- Disable auto-white balance
- Use lower ISO values

## Drone Videos

- Before starting to record for clips, survey the area to get an idea of what you want to capture
- Have a clear subject
- Composition
- Taking video with a drone gives you a lot of flexibility in movements and angles
  - [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhXF2P8QC7o) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QWnIolw_Lg) can give you some ideas
  - Take as many shots as possible from different angles and movements
- Don't mixup survey shots with video shots. It'll make it harder to find the shots you want to use on post-processing
