## Key Takeaways

- Changes should be sustainable to be long lasting. They should match our lifestyle and our preferences.
- You should work with your body, not against it.
- There's no one-size-fits-all diet or rule. You should find what works for you.

## What We Eat

- Our body craves **fatty**, **sugary**, and **salty** foods because they're calorie-dense and were scarce in the past.
- **Processed foods** are designed to be addictive.
  - The brain releases dopamine when we eat these foods.
  - Food engineers utilize this and use [bliss point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_point_(food)) in **processed food** to make them more addictive. The book calls these foods **blissy foods**.
  - All processed foods contain some level of sugar, salt, and fat.
    - Baked foods like supermarket bread are also processed foods and contain high levels of sugar and salt.
- The brain relies on leptin to regulate hunger.
  - The dopamine released by **blissy foods** can interfere with leptin and make the brain less sensitive to it, causing **leptin resistance** and making us eat more.
- Sugary food can cause a spike in blood sugar levels, which can lead to a crash later, resulting in a loop of craving more sugary food.
  - Drops in blood sugar levels can also cause irritability, mood swings, and fatigue and make you hungry.
- Day to day food is **fuel** for our body, not a source of pleasure.
  - Delicious food makes us eat more.
