# Wicked Problems

A [<Icon icon="fa-brands fa-wikipedia" size="lg" /> wicked problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem), unlike a tame problem, is a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize. Moreover, because of complex interdependencies, the effort to solve one aspect of a wicked problem may reveal or create other problems.
