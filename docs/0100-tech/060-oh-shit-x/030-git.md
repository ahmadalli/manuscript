## Cloning Multiple Repositories

To clone the whole GitHub organization, including wikis or a GitLab group, you can use [`ghorg`](https://github.com/gabrie30/ghorg)

### Overriding the Clone Path

To clone in specific directory, you need to set `GHORG_ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_CLONE_TO` and `GHORG_OUTPUT_DIR` in the configuration then the repositories will be cloned under `<GHORG_ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_CLONE_TO>/<GHORG_OUTPUT_DIR>`.

## Copying a Directory and Its History From One Repository to Another

I managed to get it working with **[this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50090278/1003464)**. [The accepted answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41814257/1003464) might also work but I haven't used it.

While they're under the same question, [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68536044/1003464) **doesn't work** because `subtree` is not suitable for this use-case and the copied commits won't have the proper directory structure in the remote repository and will corrupt the history.
