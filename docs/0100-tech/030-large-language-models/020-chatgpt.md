# ChatGPT

- If you ask ChatGPT to write a message in `informal` tone, it might go too informal. You can ask it to write in `slightly less formal` tone instead.
- Use `change as few words as possible` to make sure that the model doesn't change the input too much.
- Use `match the tone` to keep the tone.
- If you want shorter outputs, use prompts like `less than 30 words` on the task definition.
