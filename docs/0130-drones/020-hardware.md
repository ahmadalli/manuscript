# Hardware

So far, I have found DJI drones to be the best options in terms of image quality, stability, and ease of use. I get the combo versions because they come with extra batteries and a charging station, which comes in handy when you're out and about. I played with the RYZE Tello for a short time (not a good comparison, but still) and not having extra batteries was a pain.

There are some trade-offs between light and heavy drones. This mostly comes from the physical limitations of the drones. Due to the regulations of drones in most countries, there's a market for sub-250g drones, and there are good options in that market.

On the other hand, heavier drones can carry batteries with higher capacities and more powerful motors, but they're also louder and harder to travel with. Here's a simple comparison table:

| Characteristic | Light Drones | Heavy Drones |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weight | Sub 250g | 250g+ |
| Price | Low to Medium range | High |
| Stability and Wind Resistance | Low to Medium | High |
| Noise | Low | High |
| Battery Life | Low to Medium | High |
| Ease of Travel | High | Low |

## RYZE Tello

This drone is in the toy category. For indoor use, it's a good and capable option. For outdoors, it's hard to control it above 5 meters due to its light weight and small motors. It has a short battery life (around 8 minutes). It has a web API to control it programmatically.

## DJI Mini 2

I was happy with my Mini 2 when I had it. It's a sub-250g drone, and I flew around 60KM with it and took some nice photos and videos. I don't have it anymore, but sometimes I get the urge to buy another lightweight drone (like Mini 4) for its ease of travel.

## DJI Air 3

This is my current drone, and I'm happy with it. It's heavier than the Mini 2, and it's harder to travel with, especially for hiking, as the drone + controller + three batteries + ND filters add up to a lot of weight. But the image quality is better, and it's more stable in the wind, which is handy on windy days in the Netherlands.
