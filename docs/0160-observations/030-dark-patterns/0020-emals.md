# Emails

## Newsletter Subscription without Consent

Sending newsletters or any kind of promotional email, for example product updates, when user explicitly stated that they don't want to receive them is a bad practice.

## No Unsubscribe Link

Even worse than sending promotional emails without consent isn't providing an option to unsubscribe from them.
