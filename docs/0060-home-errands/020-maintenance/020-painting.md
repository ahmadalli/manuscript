### Rollerblade Marks

For some collers, rollerblades leave marks, usually seen as vertical shades, on the wall. To prevent from these marks, you should refrain from putting too much pressure on the rollers when you're painting the wall.

As rule of thomb, you shouldn almost never put any pressure on the roller.
