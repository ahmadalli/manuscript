# Cleanup

## Bathroom

### Surfaces

For surfaces, 'all-in-one' cleaning products like this [this one][hg-toilet-general] work effectively. I usually spray the whole bathroom with it and then wipe it off with a cloth.

### Sink

#### Hard Water Stains and Lime Scale

I use [this product][hg-sink-lime] to remove hard water stains and lime scale from the sink. Spray it on, let it sit for some time, and then wipe it off with a cloth.

Vinegar or lemon juice can be used to remove lime scale by soaking a cloth in it and then wrapping it around the faucet. I got [this cleaning vinegar][cleaning-vinegar] for general cleaning purposes, but I haven't tried it on the faucet yet.

### Inside of the Toilet

For the inside of the toilet: [this product][hg-toilet-inside] or if it's been a while since last cleaning: [this product][hg-toilet-inside-extra]

### Ceramic Floors and Walls

#### Tools

Instead of wiping the floors and walls with a cloth, you can utilize a tool like a [drill brush][drill-brush]and if you don't have a drill, a product like [this one][goscrub] can be used instead.

While these tools can be useful, they are not perfect. Unlike an electric toothbrush that uses a back-and-forth motion, these tools operate in a circular motion. This requires additional effort to counteract the circular motion when you need to scrub in a back-and-forth manner.

#### Cleaning Solutions

I tried vinegar, but it didn't work well especially when the surfaces haven't been cleaned for a while. A solution that contains whitener compounds works best for this, and [this product][hg-mold-moisture] worked well in this case.
