# Cleanup

## Bathroom

### Surfaces

For surfaces, all in one products work fine. I'd just spray the whole bathroom with it and then wipe it off with a cloth. I use [this HG product][hg-toilet-general] for this.

### Sink

#### Hard Water Stains and Lime Scale

I've used [this HG product][hg-sink-lime] to remove hard water stains and lime scale from the sink. Just spray it on, let it sit for some time, and then wipe it off with a cloth.

I've also read that vinegar or lemon juice can be used to remove lime scale by soaking a cloth in it and then wrapping it around the faucet. I got [this cleaning vinegar][cleaning-vinegar] for general cleaning purposes, but I haven't tried it yet on the sink yet.

### Inside of the Toilet

For the inside of the toilet: [this HG product][hg-toilet-inside] or if it's been a while since last cleaning: [this HG product][hg-toilet-inside-extra]

### Floors and Walls

I've been looking for a good way to clean the floors and walls with minimal effort. So I looked for products like electric toothbrushes, but for cleaning. There are drill attachments for this, but I don't have a drill so I got this [product][goscrub] instead. It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing.

But this needs some cleaning solution to be applied on the surface to be useful, and I tried vinegar, but it didn't work well especially when the surfaces haven't been cleaned for a while. A whitening solution works best for this, and [this HG product][hg-mold-moisture] worked well in this case.
