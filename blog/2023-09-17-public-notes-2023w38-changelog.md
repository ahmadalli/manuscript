# Public Notes Changelog: Week 38 of 2023

This week I got my drone pilot license ðŸŽ‰ and I took the opportunity and documented the process in [Legal Preparation](https://publicnotes.io/drones/legal-preparations) page.

Another topic is the games I like and enjoy. I started with [Nier Series](https://publicnotes.io/games/nier), which I strongly recommend you to play and [Rainbow Six Siege](https://publicnotes.io/games/rainbow-six), my favorite FPS game.

I also played Super Mario on the Casio Prizm. Additionally, there have been some small updates on other pages, which you can find in the changelog below:
