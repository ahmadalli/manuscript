# Public Notes Changelog: Week 31 of 2023

## Highlights

### Finding Work

I went through my own resume and based on the format, layout, and content created a detailed guide on resume preparation. I also added a new page on related Persian communities.

### Tech

#### Docusaurus

I wanted to add interactive components. I've written a short guide on creating and using a React component in Docusaurus.

#### Streaming Games

Setting up moonlight was on my to-do list for a while. I finally got around to it this weekend and documented the process along with some challenges I faced.

#### Large Language Models

I've documented my takes on the [Large Language Models and ChatGPT in 3 Weeks](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/large-language-models-and-chatgpt-in-3-weeks/0636920090988/0636920090987/) event in addition to my personal experience with ChatGPT.

### Other

- I created a 'Datasets' page as a personal reference for datasets that can be used in machine learning projects
- In the LLM event I learned about [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and created a page to keep track of product prototyping tools. I might replace current implementation of [CleverMessages](https://clevermsg.io/) with Streamlit in the future because I'm not happy with the current vue.js codebase
- I've published my internal utilities page with a guide on embedding Wikimedia media in Markdown
- I'm also working on a tool to help me generate changelogs. You can find it [here](https://github.com/ahmadalli/public-notes/blob/318a9041bb0c5a51bfc514fa5cdb42e23485ed9b/tools/changelog-generate.sh)
