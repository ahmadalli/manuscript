I almost got fired for replacing a tensioner spring on a commercial printer.

About an hour before the courier came to pick it up it hadn\u2019t printed yet so I went to see why.

The vp of Microsystems wanted me fired but when I explained that I called the on call and no one responded and that we would have missed the deliverable to the state if I hadn\u2019t done what I did the regional jumped in to tell me if I did it again I would be fired but that for this one time they would let it slide."}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'This is not a nice outcome because there are other parties in this context with their own set of needs and rules.
